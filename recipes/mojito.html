        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A mojito is a classic highball drink that originated in Cuba. Not surprisingly, this cocktail uses ingredients indigenous to Cuba, including rum, lime, mint, and sugar. The mixture is topped off with a little club soda to create a thirst-quenching libation. It requires a bit more labor than many mixed drinks, as it involves first muddling fresh mint, lime, and sugar together to release the flavors. But it's well worth it for a refreshing, fizzy, and mildly sweet rum cocktail that remains one of the most popular to this day.</p>
        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 medium lime, cut into 3 wedges, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup ice cubes, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 fluid ounces white rum</li>
            <li>1/2 cup club soda, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place mint leaves and 1 lime wedge into a sturdy glass. Use a muddler and crush to release mint oils and lime juice.</li>
            <li>Add remaining lime wedges and 2 tablespoons sugar, and muddle again to release the lime juice. Do not strain the mixture.</li>
            <li>Fill the glass almost to the top with ice. Pour in rum and fill the glass with club soda.</li>
            <li>Stir, taste, and add more sugar if desired.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
